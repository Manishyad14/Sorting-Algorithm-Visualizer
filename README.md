# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A React-based visualizer for popular sorting algorithms, built with TypeScript and Framer Motion. This application provides an intuitive way to see sorting algorithms in action, helping users understand the steps involved in each sorting process.

## 🔍 Features

- **Sorting Algorithms Supported:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort
- **Visualization:** Animated bars representing array elements, dynamically updated during sorting
- **Customizable Speed:** Control the sorting speed for better understanding
- **Array Reset:** Generate a new random array at any time
- **Responsive Design:** Works on all device sizes

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** with TypeScript for the front-end framework
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## 🖥️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-algorithms-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open the app**  
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the visualizer in action.

## 📄 Usage

1. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the speed slider to control the sorting speed.
3. Click **Start Sorting** to begin the visualization. You can see the steps of the algorithm in real time.
4. Press **Reset Array** to generate a new random array for sorting.
